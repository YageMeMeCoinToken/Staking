Documentos Legales Completos para YageCoin Platform
Dado que tu plataforma es MÁS compleja (Swap, Bridge, News, Tokens, NFTs, Planes de Inversión), necesitas protección legal más robusta.

⚠️ ALERTA IMPORTANTE: Planes de Inversión
CRÍTICO: Los "planes de inversión" son el elemento MÁS RIESGOSO legalmente. Dependiendo de cómo estén estructurados, podrían clasificarse como:

❌ Valores/Securities (requiere registro SEC en USA)
❌ Esquema Ponzi (si pagas rendimientos de nuevos inversores)
❌ Producto financiero regulado (requiere licencias)

RECOMENDACIÓN URGENTE:

Define EXACTAMENTE qué son estos "planes de inversión"
Si prometen rendimientos garantizados = ALTO RIESGO LEGAL
Considera eliminar esta sección o reestructurar como "staking" o "yield farming"
